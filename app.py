    The goal of this competition is to predict MDS-UPDR scores, which measure progression in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
    The Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a comprehensive assessment of both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's. 
    You will develop a model trained on data of protein and peptide levels over time in subjects with Parkinson‚Äôs disease versus normal age-matched control subjects.
    
    Your work could help provide important breakthrough information about which molecules change as Parkinson‚Äôs disease progresses.

    Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) is a disabling brain disorder that affects movements, cognition, sleep, and other normal functions. 
    Unfortunately, there is no current cure‚Äîand the disease worsens over time. It's estimated that by 2037, 1.6 million people in the U.S. will have Parkinson‚Äôs disease, 
    at an economic cost approaching $80 billion. Research indicates that protein or peptide abnormalities play a key role in the onset and worsening of this disease. 
    Gaining a better understanding of this‚Äîwith the help of data science‚Äîcould provide important clues for the development of new pharmacotherapies to slow the progression or cure Parkinson‚Äôs disease.
    
    Current efforts have resulted in complex clinical and neurobiological data on over 10,000 subjects for broad sharing with the research community. 
    A number of important findings have been published using this data, but clear biomarkers or cures are still lacking.
    
    Competition host, the Accelerating Medicines Partnership¬Æ Parkinson‚Äôs Disease (AMP¬ÆPD), is a public-private partnership between government, industry, and nonprofits that is managed through the Foundation of the National Institutes of Health (FNIH). 
    The Partnership created the AMP PD Knowledge Platform, which includes a deep molecular characterization and longitudinal clinical profiling of Parkinson‚Äôs disease patients, with the goal of identifying and validating diagnostic, prognostic, and/or disease progression biomarkers for Parkinson‚Äôs disease.
    
    Your work could help in the search for a cure for Parkinson‚Äôs disease, which would alleviate the substantial suffering and medical care costs of patients with this disease.
